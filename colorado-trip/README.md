# colorado-trip

A toolbox of one-shot Python scripts that built up a Google Sheet itinerary for a Colorado trip. Each script populated a specific section (backpacking, dining, dog daycare, scenic stops, shuttle, trail rides). The Sheet is the deliverable; the scripts are the journey to get there.

## What it is

```
  research-context.md ──┐
  trail-rides JSON   ──┐│
  scenic stops       ──┼┴──▶ add_<section>.py ──▶ Google Sheet (itinerary)
  dining guide       ──┘
```

Each script is independent. They were run in roughly the order of the file listing.

## Audience

You — personal travel planning. Trip-specific, not a generic trip-planner.

## Status

Trip-specific artifact. Functional but most useful as a reference if you build similar trip-planning tooling for a future trip.

## Layout

- `research-context.md` — narrative doc; the only prose. Read this first if you're picking up where things left off.
- 14+ `add_*.py` scripts — each populated one Sheet section. The Activities-tab builders
  (`add_activities.py`, `add_backpacking_sheet.py`, `add_tahoe_mammoth_content.py`,
  `add_trail_rides.py`) are now **legacy/historical** — see the MTB + styling pipeline below.
- `restructure_itinerary.py` — periodic reorg sweeps
- `read_itinerary.py` — fetch current state of the Sheet
- `fix_backpacking_stats.py` — corrections to specific sections

### Activities tab — current pipeline (Hikes / Runs / MTB)

All MTB rides live in the `Activities — Hikes, Runs & MTB` tab. The look + the MTB
content are maintained by these (idempotent, safe to re-run):

- `sheet_style.py` — shared palette + column widths (single source of truth for the look).
- `restyle_activities.py` — reads the tab and unifies **formatting only** (section/sub-area/
  column-header bars, zebra striping, widths). Content-safe; never rewrites trip data.
  Styles the activity sections above the `🚵 MOUNTAIN BIKING` header.
- `update_activities_mtb.py` — owns the **MTB section** (Boulder / Steamboat / Crested Butte
  ride data + per-row Google Maps trailhead pins, Trailforks deep-links, `***` must-do
  marks, hype badges). Rewrites only that section; preserves everything above it.
- `mtb_tab.py` — builder used by `update_activities_mtb.py`.
- `activities_links.py` — Activities-tab link master: adds Google Maps trailhead pins to
  each activity's Trailhead cell **and** labels bare URLs in the Link column
  (`AllTrails ▸`, `TAMBA ▸`, …). Activity region only; the MTB section carries its own
  links. (Consolidates the former `add_activities_trailhead_links.py` + `clean_activity_links.py`.)
- `linkutil.py` — turns `=HYPERLINK(...)` cells into native (always-clickable) links.

To change a ride: edit `update_activities_mtb.py` then run it. To re-polish formatting:
run `restyle_activities.py`. To (re)apply trailhead pins + Link labels: run
`activities_links.py`. All pull colors from `sheet_style.py`.

**Not Activities-specific** (left as-is): `fix_all_hyperlinks.py` / `fix_bare_url_cells.py`
are document-wide link maintenance; `rebuild_trip_tabs.py`, `add_day_tabs.py`,
`add_trailhead_distances.py` build other tabs.

## Setup

```bash
cd colorado-trip
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install gspread google-auth google-api-python-client  # ad-hoc, no pinned reqs
```

Each script reads/writes a Google Sheet via gspread; you'll need a service-account JSON to authenticate.

## Future

Probably retire after the trip, OR — if you take more trips — extract the stable patterns (Sheet bootstrap, multi-tab section adds, scenic-stop schema) into a reusable trip-planner sketch. Don't generalize prematurely.

## Out of scope

- Generic trip-planning library
- Cross-trip reuse without intent
- Real-time travel updates

## Reference

This is preserved as a reference for one specific trip. If you read this in 6 months and don't remember the trip, it's probably safe to retire (after archiving the Sheet PDF).
